# VAX project
### Research Strategy
- Aim 1. Develope a Baysian model while incorporating multilevel vaccine and AE ontologies to improve vaccine safety surveillance.
- Aim 1a. Develop a new Bayesian model that incorporates a three-level (child-parent-grandparent) AE ontology structure to detect vaccine safety issues on multiple ontology levels.
By using a hierarchical model, we incorporate the parent-level ontology into the signal detection method and allow for signal detection on both the child and parent level. <br>
By using a Graph Laplacian prior with the NB model, we further incorporate the grandparent-level ontology into the signal detection method.
